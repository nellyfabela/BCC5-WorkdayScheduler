## BootCamp Challenge05


## Description

This challenge was more difficult than the last one but after understanding deeply more information and terminology on JavaScript I got to get better. Having the access to all the information from the bootcamp and the internet browsers allows me to understand better what I'm doing, as well having a tutor is super helpful for details I don't realize make the difference.

## Installation

For this Challenge I used mainly VSCode and internet broswers. 

## UserStudy 
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## Usage

The website should be looking like this, example it is already at night and the schedule ends at 5pm so the color for past is blue-ish..
